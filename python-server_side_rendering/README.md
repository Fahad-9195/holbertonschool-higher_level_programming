# Server-Side Rendering with Flask

## 📌 Description
This project focuses on **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** using **Python** and the **Flask** framework.  
Server-side rendering generates complete HTML pages on the server and sends them to the client, improving performance, SEO, and maintainability compared to client-side rendering.

The project uses the **Jinja2 templating engine** to dynamically generate HTML and integrates multiple data sources such as **JSON**, **CSV**, and **SQLite databases**.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Understand the concept of **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**
- Explain the difference between **server-side rendering** and **client-side rendering**
- Identify the benefits of using SSR in modern web applications
- Implement SSR using **Python** and **Flask**
- Use **Jinja2** templates to generate dynamic HTML pages
- Read and display data from:
  - JSON files
  - CSV files
  - SQLite databases
- Handle dynamic content and user inputs in Flask applications

## 🧠 What to Expect
In this project, you will build a **Flask web application** that renders pages on the server using SSR techniques.  

You will:
1. Create basic Flask routes and templates
2. Use Jinja2 for dynamic HTML generation
3. Load and display data from multiple data sources
4. Handle dynamic routing and user inputs
5. Build efficient, scalable, and SEO-friendly web pages

By the end of the project, you will have a solid understanding of server-side rendering and templating in Python-based web applications.

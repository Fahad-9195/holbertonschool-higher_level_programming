## Overview
In modern software development, efficient communication and data exchange between systems is essential.  
This project explores **RESTful APIs**, a core element of web services.

**REST (Representational State Transfer)** is an architectural style that follows constraints such as:
- Stateless communication
- Cacheability
- Uniform interface
- Client-server separation
- Scalability

This project covers API consumption (CLI + Python), API development (http.server + Flask), and fundamentals of security and documentation.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Understand **HTTP/HTTPS** fundamentals (methods, headers, status codes)
- Consume APIs using **Command Line tools** (e.g., `curl`)
- Consume APIs using **Python**
- Build a basic API using Python **http.server**
- Build REST APIs using **Flask**
- Apply basic **API Security & Authentication**
- Document APIs using **OpenAPI standards**

## Why RESTful APIs Matter
RESTful APIs are the backbone of system integration:
- Mobile apps ↔ Backend services
- Microservices ↔ Microservices
- Third-party systems ↔ Internal systems

APIs translate requests into actions: fetch data, update records, or trigger operations.  
Learning how to design and consume APIs is a key modern engineering skill.

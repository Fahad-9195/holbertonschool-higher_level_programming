# Python - Objects, Mutability and References

## Project Overview
This project explores how Python handles objects, memory, and variable references.  
It focuses on understanding identity, mutability, aliasing, and how variables behave when assigned or passed to functions.

Understanding these concepts is essential for writing efficient and predictable Python programs.

## Key Concepts

**Mutable Types**
- list
- dict
- set

**Immutable Types**
- int
- float
- str
- tuple

**Identity vs Equality**
- `is` checks identity
- `==` checks value

# Python - MySQL & SQLAlchemy ORM

## Description
This project links two powerful worlds: **Databases** and **Python**.

In the first part, you will use the **MySQLdb** module to connect to a MySQL database and execute SQL queries directly from Python.

In the second part, you will use **SQLAlchemy**, an Object Relational Mapper (ORM), to interact with the database using Python objects instead of writing SQL queries.

The goal is to understand how to manipulate relational data both with and without an ORM, and to see the advantages of abstraction, portability, and maintainability.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain (without Google):

- How to connect to a MySQL database from a Python script
- How to SELECT rows in a MySQL table from a Python script
- How to INSERT rows in a MySQL table from a Python script
- What ORM means
- How to map a Python class to a MySQL table

## Requirements
- OS: **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS**
- Python: **3.8.5**
- MySQL: **8.0.25**
- MySQLdb: **2.0.x**
- SQLAlchemy: **1.4.x**
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files must end with a new line
- The first line of all files must be exactly: `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- All files must be executable
- Code must follow `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.*)
- All modules, classes, and functions must have documentation strings
- You are not allowed to use `execute` with SQLAlchemy
- A `README.md` file is mandatory at the root of the project folder

## Setup Environment

### Install MySQL (if not using sandbox)

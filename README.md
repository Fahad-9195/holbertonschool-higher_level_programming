📘 README.md — Python Introduction Project
0x00. Python — Hello, World
Author’s Disclaimer

Welcome to the Python world!

With Python — like most high-level languages — you’ll soon notice that there are many ways to achieve the same goal. Some tasks will require a specific implementation, while others allow for multiple correct solutions.

Python also has an official style guide called PEP8, now known as PyCode. At Holberton, we don’t enforce PyCode strictly at the beginning since it is more rigid than PEP8.
So if you encounter PyCode warnings at this early stage, don’t worry — you can safely ignore them.

Enjoy your learning journey!

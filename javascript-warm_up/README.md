# JavaScript - Scripting

## Background Context
JavaScript is a powerful and versatile programming language used for many purposes, including scripting and web front-end development.

In this project, JavaScript is used mainly for **scripting**, similar to how Python scripts are written. This project focuses on learning the **core concepts of JavaScript**, which will later be applied to make the AirBnB project dynamic using JavaScript and jQuery.
